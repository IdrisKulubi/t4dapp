## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Auto-save Architecture
```typescript
// Auto-save every 30 seconds
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(saveDraft, 30000);
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, [saveDraft]);

// Debounced save on form changes
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = form.watch(() => {
    const timeoutId = setTimeout(saveDraft, 2000);
    return () => clearTimeout(timeoutId);
  });
  return () => subscription.unsubscribe();
}, [form, saveDraft]);
```

### Draft Storage Format
```typescript
const draftData = {
  data: formData,           // Complete form data
  timestamp: string,        // ISO timestamp
  activeStep: string,       // Current step ID
  completedSteps: string[]  // Array of completed step IDs
}
```

### Navigation with Scroll
```typescript
const scrollToTop = () => {
  window.scrollTo({
    top: 0,
    behavior: 'smooth'
  });
};
```

## ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Improvements

### Auto-save Indicators
- Loading spinner when saving
- "Auto-saved" status with timestamp
- Toast notifications for manual saves
- Draft restoration notification with clear option

### Download Features
- JSON format for easy data portability
- Descriptive filenames with dates
- Success notifications
- Available in multiple locations for convenience

### Form Navigation
- Smooth page transitions
- Consistent scroll behavior
- Better user experience when moving between steps

## ðŸ“± Mobile Responsiveness

All new features are fully responsive:
- Auto-save indicators adapt to mobile layout
- Download buttons properly sized for touch
- Scroll behavior works on all devices
- Toast notifications positioned appropriately

## ðŸ”’ Data Persistence

- **Local Storage**: Used for draft saving (client-side only)
- **Privacy**: No sensitive data transmitted during auto-save
- **Cleanup**: Drafts automatically cleared after successful submission
- **Recovery**: Robust error handling for corrupted draft data

## ðŸ§ª Testing Recommendations

To test the implemented features:

1. **Auto-save**: Fill out form fields and wait 30 seconds or make changes and wait 2 seconds
2. **Draft Recovery**: Refresh the page after making changes
3. **Download**: Click download buttons at various stages
4. **Scroll Behavior**: Navigate between steps and observe smooth scrolling
5. **Name Visibility**: Check that first/last name fields are clearly visible and functional

## ðŸ“‹ Remaining Items (Not in Scope)

The following items from `review.md` were not implemented as they require different types of changes:

- Email notification setup (requires backend email service configuration)
- Non-Google email signup (requires authentication provider changes)
- Date picker improvements (requires calendar component updates)
- Infrastructure description clarification (content changes)
- FAQ updates (content changes)
- Brand color alignment (design system changes)
- Content cleanup and reorganization (content management)

## ðŸš€ Deployment Notes

All changes are backward compatible and can be deployed immediately. The auto-save feature gracefully handles missing localStorage support in older browsers.
